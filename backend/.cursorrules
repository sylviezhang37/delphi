# Cursor Rule â€” Backend (Python)

## Style

- Follow PEP8, add type hints everywhere.
- Small, focused functions; no large dumps of code.
- Clear docstrings; validate inputs early.
- Prefer logging over print.

## Collaboration

- Work step by step:
  1. Outline plan/checklist.
  2. Scaffold with stubs/types.
  3. Implement smallest slice.
  4. Show tests/smoke run.
  5. Refine & add error handling.
- After each step: stop and confirm before continuing.
- Show diffs for edits, not whole files unless new.
